## Use Linear Regression To Estimate Continuous Values (Regression) with Python and Scikit-learn

Linear regression is a linear model that is used for regression problems, 
or problems where the goal is to predict a value on a continuous spectrum (as opposed to a discrete category).



1.We read data from a file in the same folder as the program Salary.csv using pandas
2.We divide our dataset into x and y
3.We split dataset into training and test dataset
4.Using sklearn we import linear regression model to implement our classifier
5.Using matplotlib.pyplot we plot the values.

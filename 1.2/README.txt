Logistic Regression is a simple machien learning method you can use to predict the value of a numeric categorical varible based on its relationship with predictor values
Here in this program we arre using data mtcars,
drat and carb as predictors and as are predictant which is binary

#also this example does not use test_train_split

Logistic Regression assumptions

	Data is free of missing values
	Predictant variable (target ) is either binary or ordinal
	All predictors are independent of each other
	There should be around 50 observations to ensure reliable results
